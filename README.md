# Hand_Gesture_Recognition

This Hand Gesture recognition allows you to control the keys without using the keyboard and just by using your hands.

The recognizable gestures include:
>> Move your hand with fist open to the right-move right

>> Move your hand with fist open to the left-move left

>> Move your hand with fist open to the up - jump/move up

>> Move your hand with fist open to the down- roll/move down

This allows you to control our all-time-favourite games such as Subway Surfers,Temple Run,the Dino Run and others that have similar controls of using up,down,right,left keys while playing on PC without a keyboard
